# Verification

## 1. Objective

The objective of verification is to ensure that the asynchronous FIFO:
- Works correctly under different operating conditions
- Does not overflow or underflow
- Safely transfers data across different clock domains

Verification is used to **validate the RTL design**, not to replace it.

---

## 2. Verification Approach

The FIFO is verified using:
- SystemVerilog
- UVM-based testbench
- SystemVerilog Assertions
- Functional coverage

Both **directed tests** and **constrained-random tests** are used to check normal and corner-case behavior.

---

## 3. Testbench Architecture

The verification environment follows standard UVM architecture and includes the following components:

### Driver
- Drives read and write transactions to the FIFO
- Uses transaction-level inputs generated by sequences

### Monitor
- Observes FIFO interface signals
- Collects write and read data for checking

### Scoreboard
- Compares data written into the FIFO with data read out
- Ensures data integrity across clock domains

### Assertions
- Check for illegal operations such as:
  - Write when FIFO is full
  - Read when FIFO is empty
- Help detect errors early during simulation

### Functional Coverage
- Tracks important FIFO states such as:
  - Empty condition
  - Full condition
  - Normal read/write operation
- Helps measure verification completeness

---

## 4. Test Cases Implemented

The following test cases are implemented:

- Simple directed write and read test
- Reset behavior test
- Random stress test with asynchronous clocks
- Simultaneous read and write operations

These tests help verify correct FIFO behavior under both normal and stress conditions.

---

## 5. CDC Verification

Clock Domain Crossing (CDC) correctness is verified by:
- Using independent and asynchronous read and write clocks
- Stress testing the FIFO with random read/write activity
- Using assertions to detect unsafe conditions
- Checking data integrity using the scoreboard

---

## 6. Summary

The verification strategy ensures that:
- FIFO functionality is correct
- Overflow and underflow conditions are prevented
- CDC behavior is safe and reliable
- RTL design works as expected

This verification environment supports and strengthens the RTL design of the asynchronous FIFO.
