# Asynchronous FIFO Verification using UVM

## Overview
This project implements and verifies an asynchronous FIFO using a UVM-based
verification environment. The FIFO operates across independent read and write
clock domains and uses Gray-code pointers for safe clock-domain crossing.

## Features
- Dual-clock asynchronous FIFO
- Gray-code pointer synchronization
- UVM-based verification environment
- Constrained random stimulus
- Assertions for CDC correctness
- Functional coverage

## Tools
- SystemVerilog
- UVM
- ModelSim / Questa / Xcelium / Verilator

## Status
RTL implementation in progress
